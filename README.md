## What is The Spark?

**The Spark** is the open, universal symbol of human-centered Generative AI.

It represents the moment where input becomes imagination — a glowing spark at the center of an infinity loop. It is the mark of creative intelligence, endlessly evolving, powered by human intent.

> **“From one human spark, infinite creation.”**
